# DaZeus Noms Plugin

This plugin allows users to check the menu for the restaurants on the Radboud University campus.
Currently, the following restaurants are supported:

* Het Gerecht (Grotius building)
* Radboud UMC hospital restaurant

Support for De Refter will be re-introduced when it reopens. Its new 'food court' nature is
likely to have consequences for the presentation of its menu, so it has been left unimplemented for now.
